  <article class="content">
    Part of getting to a better place in the new year is recognizing
    where we have sway, and going past our own discomfort to create positive
    change in ourselves and in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring
    process can do better by thinking critically about culture fit. Matt Griffin
    challenges us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of team that’s the
    best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us comfortable by surrounding us
    with people largely like ourselves in ways that aren’t relevant to the business.
